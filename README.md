###### Group Members:
 - Cau√£ Adomaitis
 - Nicholas LoPilato


###### Our purpose:
- We wanted to simplify the way you look for the price on some items that you want to buy. Instead of just saving the URL of a product, we wanted notifications on price drops, and a list where we could identify different items.

###### Features:

-	Scraping data from a Website.
-	Treating the HTML data and collecting essential points out of it.
-	Notifications via Discord. Discord notifications pops-up on any device (mobile/desktop).
-	Easy-to-use GUI, with text fields, buttons, and tables.


###### Definitions:

- Discord: A communication/social platform, mostly used by communities for an easy way of comminication.
- Webhook: An easy way to send data through the internet using HTTP requests, almost like an API.


###### Technologies:

- Jsoup in order to scrape elements from the webpage.
- JavaFX to generate content in an application for the user.
- HTTP Requests to send JSON data through the webhook.
